Problem:

Fill out information for beaucratic red tape only once electronically on a tablet and transfer it to the appropriate places on all of the documents (in, say, a PDF format). Must allow for reading of documents first before signing.

User will real documents and then go through and fill out the appropriate fields with a wand. When done the program transfers input data to appropriate places on document.

That means the fields must be identified and labeled first. Then the different fields will need to be created in the app for user to fill out.

Classes:

Fields - the fields the user will input.

string name
int* signature  <--Pretend it's a pointer to the image until understood how to implement image.
string date



Documents - The documents which will be created where the different fields will be identified for the Fields class.
