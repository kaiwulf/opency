This is the accompanying source code to The GNOME 2 Developer's Guide, by
Matthias Warkus (No Starch Press, http://www.nostarch.com/).

The code is arranged by chapter in the following subdirectories:

chapter1: GLib
chapter2: GObject
chapter3: GTK+
chapter4: GNOME 
chapter5: Glade 
chapter6: Other Tools (autoconf, gettext, intltool, etc.)
chapter7: GConf
chapter8: GnomeVFS

Each programming example comes with a small Makefile that should work fine
with a properly-configured GNOME 2 system. The exception to this is the
Chapter 6 example, a fairly extensive source tree demonstration of the
GNU autoconf system.

This source code comes under the terms of the GNU GPL; see the COPYING file
