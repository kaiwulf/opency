            Placing computer science under some already existing field, such as engineering, proves to be tricky. Engineering is characterized by standardized precision which is lacking in software development. Industry standards have been established, programming languages are standardized. In addition to mathematicians, electrical engineers were the first computer programmers. So its relation to engineering is very strong. However, compared to other engineering fields, the level or rigor programming is standardized is mangitudes short of other fields, such as civil engineering or mechanical engineering. As a matter of fact, many of the programming languages have unspecified behavior for undefined behavior. It's often left up to the designers of the compiler to determine what behavior will result from the undefiend behavior. Leaving undefined behavior up to the implementors in other fields of engineering would be highly unusual and considered unprofessional.

        <p>
			Maynard Solomon, in <i>Beethoven</i>, quotes Martin Bubar: "The vision 'what should be' - independent though it may sometimes appear
			of personal will - is yet inseparable from a critical and fundamental relationship to the existing condition of
			humanity. All suffering under a social order that is senseless prepares the soul for vision."
		</p>

		<p> He then goes on to state: </p>

		<p>
			"[F]inally, if the trajectory of utopian art leads towards a transcendant future, and its origins are in a diseased
			present, its dreamed-of alternatives are modeled on memories or fantasies of an edenic state."
		</p>

		<p>
			There should be no doubt to the average observer that the "Technological Singularity" is Utopain and Edenic. It's
			Edenic not like past Utopias, but in an inverted sense. The Technological Singularity dogma rejects the concept of
			an Edenic past state but promises, through technology, entry to an harmonious Universalism and Edenic future.
		</p>

		<p>
			It should go without saying to any thoughtful individual that Edenic Univeralism can be promised by no one. The
			Technological Singularity is no exception.
		</p>

		<p>
			So naturally one must ask, "if not the Technological Singularity, what's next?"
		</p>

		<p>
			The answer is not so obvious from the outset. It's a question which requires some reflection. Such reflection
			is far too extensive for this brief essay. However, within the context of engineering and technology, the proposed
			answer is the merging of humans and technology to the point of indistinguishability. However, the natural question
			to ask after that is, "what's the point?" Isn't life about living? Where is the humanity in such a vision? To be quite
			frank, there is none. Instead of humans working like slaves for technology, we need technology to work for us.
		</p>

		<h3> History </h3>

		<p>
			The philosophy of OpenCy was arrived at independently, but later influenced by, Douglas Engelbart's ARC and vision of
			human augmented learning. His ideas were further elaborated on at Xerox SPARC. The rest is history.
		</p>

		<p>
			Engelbart's influence on computing has a long reach. The invention of the mouse and GUI user interface is integral
			to all modern desktop and laptop computers. Smartphones and tablets are a minor variation, switching from a GUI and
			mouse to a GUI and finger taps. From there, unfortunately, evolution of human-computer interfacing and human augmented
			learning has halted. Despite the enormous potential for more sophisticated human-computer interfacing to augment
			human learning, all research in this domain has all but ceased.
		</p>

		<h5> Isn't Virtual Reality and Occulus Rift one step closer in this direction? </h5>

		<p>
			Virtual reality has the potential. The question remains: is it fulfilling that potential? The business model of Occulus Rift
			and similar virtual reality companies is unfortunately going towards a world of more of the same. Zuckerberg is using Occulus Rift
			for banal social media and Facebook purposes. Other virtual reality companies are choosing pornography as a much more desirable
			direction to take this technology. The way virtual reality is being implemented now does not hold that promise.
		</p>

		<h3> Aesthetics </h3>

		<p>
			OpenCy aims for a certain aesthetic which is not only the character of OpenCy, but also fuel for innovation and invention. OpenCy
			embraces the lessons learned from the past, which inform the modern day standards and practices, while staying determined to remain
			fresh and not get bogged down in the bureaucratiztion of today's tech industry and academia.
		</p>

		<p>
			The aesthetics of OpenCy resembles the spirit of the early hacker years and the innovative Silicon Valley days circa the 1990's.
			Over the decades, many problems in computing have been solved. The time when most problems were wide open and the best practices were
			way out in the horizon are allegedly over. To a degree they are. However, the best practices are often a compromise established to better
			facilitate interoperability within large bureaucratic processes. Or make e̶m̶p̶l̶o̶y̶e̶e̶s̶ cogs easily replaceable. OpenCy views this compromise
			too great a cost and too restrictive. Research is aimed at rising above the bureacratic process and focusing instead on a philosophy of
			localization.
