    <h3> About </h3>

    <p>
        OpenCy is about providing solutions to today's technical challenges by employing novel human-computer integration and augmented intelligence.
    </p>

    <h3> What is "human-computer integration"? </h3>

	<p>
		As opposed to the promise of transhumanism and the Technological Singularity, OpenCy adopts the philosophy of putting people first instead of
		technology. Instead of changing Man to adapt to technology, OpenCy seeks to adapt technology to accommodate humans. Humans are the product of
		billions of years of evolution. OpenCy considers it the height of foolishness to drastically alter humans, who in a way, are a biomechanical
		machines, more advanced than any machine created by man. Before making any fundamental change to humans it's a better idea to optimize what
		is already there.
	</p>

	<h3> Is OpenCy about Intelligence Augementation (IA)? </h3>

	<p>
		Yes and no. OpenCy is primarily software based (at this time) and isn't focused on any form of bioengineering. At this time OpenCy is only developing
		the software tools which could assist in that effort later down the line. But the same reasoning that OpenCy applies to AI it also applies to IA.
