<H3><FONT COLOR=GRAY>INTRODUCTION:</FONT></H3>
BetterOS.org is dedicated to freely providing software to you, which runs better.<BR>
Today's computers have gotten very fast. <A HREF=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law>Moore's Law</A> states the the number of transistors that can be built into a microchip will double every two years. Theoretically, this means that (in general) the speed of a computer doubles every two years. This law has been proven to hold true for a long time now. Computer processors get faster and faster as time progresses, and also use less power.<BR>
So, a computer from two years ago should be twice as slow as a new computer today, correct? That <I>would</I> be true, if computers were only hardware, but computers also need software to perform any kind of useful task. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">Wirth's Law</A> states that computer software is becoming slower faster than computer hardware is becoming faster.<BR>
The modern software developer has gotten quite lazy. When computer programming was beginning, programmers had to be careful not to use too many resources, and to make sure their programs ran as efficiently as possible. Many programs were written in Assembly in that day. Then computers got faster, and faster and faster, and now today, programmers write code in C#, or Java, which gets compiled to byte-code (not machine code) and interpreted by a virtual machine, and uses garbage collection, because today's programmers are too lazy to even manage memory properly, I can't think of a better way to waste resources. Nowadays, everybody is worried about "going green" and conserving our planet's resources, but in the meantime we are wasting all of our computer machine's man-made resources.<BR>
How do programmers get away with writing such bad code, you ask? They don't care, and many of them believe that computers are so fast now that no one will notice. Unfortunately, nobody is noticing, but the only reason is because nobody knows what good software looks like anymore. Computers used to run on 64 megabytes of RAM with 1 gigabyte hard drives, now we have 2 terabyte hard drives and 4 gigabytes of ram, and we still use all of it. We don't do new things, we watch videos, write documents, browse the web, so why do we need all that RAM and hard drive space?<BR>
<H4>Because application programming has gone to hell.</H4>

<FONT COLOR=GRAY>MISSION:</FONT></H3>
Our mission is to start a revival of good programming, by providing software which is less crappy, and raising awareness about how terrible modern software programming has become.<BR>
Software which is available on this website will NEVER be written in Java or C#, and will always strive to be as efficient as possible.<BR>
