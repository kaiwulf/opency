		<h4> <a name="molecule">Molecule</a> </h4>

		<p>
				Molecule is a molecular simulator. With it, the user explores the interaction of bio-molecules in real time, allowing the researcher
				to investigate biodynamics, protein-protein interaction, gene duplication, etc., in real time and interactively.
		</p>

		<h4> <a name="formulae">Formulae</a> </h4>

		<p>
			Formulae most closely resembles a Computer Algebra System (CAS) in the way it is used. The user inputs mathematical
			information according to Formulae's custom programming language and the interpreter represents the information graphically. However,
			how Formulae differs from CAS systems is it doesn't represent the information on a Cartesian graph, but as an abstract visual
			representation. The visual representation is a <b>graphical</b> based language, as opposed to a symbol based language we use in writing and
			formulating mathematical expressions, equations and theorems. The power of this is not only does this allow the user to
			visually understand how the different components in a mathematical construct interact, it will also allow the user to input
			mathematical theorems which will then be translated in to the graphical language. Which, in turn, will allow for the user to
			see how the different parts of mathematical theorems interact, build on each other, visually.
		</p>

		<h4> <a name="fysik">fysik</a> </h4>

		<p>
			fysik is like Formulae. The difference is it's a physics simulator. The user inputs the necessary mathematical machinery
			to describe the situation he is examining. The mathematical and physical relationships would then be represented in a
			graphical language the user would then use to explore relationships and connections within the physical system. Additionally,
			mathematical formula can be modified to explore the consequences if the mathematical relationships were different. For example,
			if force were equal to the square root of mass times acceleration. Another possibility fysik would be able to explore is the
			hypothetical scenario where matter is composed of forms of matter different from the standard proton, neutron, electron, etc.,
			and was goverened by different atomic forces.

		<h4> <a name="cym">Cym</a> </h4>

		<p>
			Cym is a tool for code flow and debugging visualization.

		<h4> <a name="os">Operating Systems</a> </h4>

		<p>
			Operating Systems are the most complex and advanced computer applications any computer uses. Any attempt to create a new, novel
			operating system from scratch inevitably encounters the problem of keeping up with all the latest hardware, scheduling algorithms
			and the many, varied tasks which go in to developing a state of the art operating system. This problem
